#Notes

#time.sleep(2) -> wait 2 seconds

#time.gmtime(0) for system's epoch

#time.time() for seconds since epoch

#time.time_ns(), time since epoch but in nanoseconds

#time.ctime() for current time as a string  -> Thu Nov  4 14:31:35 2021 - DAY MONTH DAYOFMONTH HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND YEAR
#or give it a time() inside -> t = time then ctime(t) -> string of that t time
#If you donâ€™t pass an argument, then ctime() uses the return value of time() by default.
#the timestamp returned by ctime() depends on your geographical location. -> modifiable on the pc settings
#  Since local time is related to your locale, timestamps often account for locale-specific details such as the order of the elements in
#  the string and translations of the day and month abbreviations.
#  ctime() ignores these details.
# The representation of time dependent on your physical location is called local time and makes use of a concept called time zones.
